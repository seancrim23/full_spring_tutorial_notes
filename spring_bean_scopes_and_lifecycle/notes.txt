spring - spring beans scopes and lifecycle
***************************************************************************

- bean scopes
	- refers to lifecycle of bean
	- how long does it live?
	- how many instances are created?
	- how is it shared?
	
- default bean scope: SINGLETON
	- one instance of bean
	- all requests for the bean returns a shared reference for that bean
	
- PROTOTYPE scope
	- NEW object is created for each request
		- ex: <bean id="myCoach"
				class="com.luv2code.springdemo.TrackCoach"
				scope="prototype">
				...
			  </bean>
			  
- other scopes exist mainly for web programming

- Bean lifecycle methods / hooks
	- can add custom code during bean initialization
		- call custom business logic methods
		- set up handles to resources (db, sockets, files, etc)
	- can add custom code during bean destruction
		- calling custom business logic methods
		- clean up handles to resources (db, sockets, files etc)
		
	- easy as defining properties in the bean
		- ex: <bean id="myCoach"
				class="com.luv2code.springdemo.TrackCoach"
				init-method="doMyStartupStuff"
				destroy-method="doMyCleanupStuff" > // startup and cleanup can be any method
			...
			</bean>
		 
		- simply define methods for init and destroy
		- configure the method names in spring config file
		
	- MOSTLY FOR SETTING UP AND TEARING DOWN, THE METHODS WILL BASICALLY ALWAYS BE VOID
